## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I've faced many challenges. I was unable to solve past excerise as I am stuggling with closures and understanding how they work and how to build them.
I felt that there's a lot of parts of the code that was given in which I don't understand which was making it overwhelming for me
